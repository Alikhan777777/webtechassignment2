            <h2>About Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
            <p id="text1">
                Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs journey began on the small island of Madeira, where dreams seemed far away but his
                determination burned close. As a young boy, he left his family behind to chase football in Lisbon,
                enduring loneliness, sacrifice, and countless challenges. His speed, skill, and work ethic quickly set
                him apart, but it was his hunger to improve that made him unstoppable.

            <p id="text2">
                He transformed his body and mind through relentless training, refusing to settle for anything less than
                perfection. Step by step, he rose from Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and
                back to Manchester, conquering every league he touched. What started as a boy‚Äôs dream on a remote island
                became the path of a legend who turned obstacles into milestones and ambition into history.
